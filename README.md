post-mortem replay debugger for python.

I've always been interested in being able to view complete memory trace timelines without having to apply an explicit breakpoint. This is a proof-of-concept I spun up with the help of my friend Chad G. Petey which will create a memory report of a python program's execution which can be viewed and analyzed over time the same way you might examine a .pcap file in WireShark.
